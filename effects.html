        <h1>Effect on indoor air pollution</h1>
            <p>Indoor plants reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly <a href="volatile organic compounds">volatile organic compounds </a> (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. These VOC's have been reported to reduce by about 50-75&#37; with the presence of a houseplant. The compounds are removed primarily by soil microorganisms. Some tests of benzene purification by houseplants noticed that plants can makeup and convert benzene, then transform it to a carbon use for future use. Plants can also remove carbon dioxide, which is correlated with lower work performance, from indoor areas. The effect has been investigated by NASA for use in spacecraft. Plants also appear to reduce airborne microbes and increase humidity. VOCs are more common in indoor areas than outdoors. This is because air and VOCs get trapped in indoor spaces; there is less air circulation. There are over 350 known VOCs. They are causative agents for “building-related illness” or “sick-building syndrome”. Symptoms of this illness include: irritated eyes, nose or throat, headache, drowsiness and breathing problems. These symptoms may not always be present, however, and chronic exposure may lead to lack of concentration and other health issues such as asthma and heart disease. Urban dwellers spend up to 90&#37; of their time indoors so they are at higher risk of experiencing the adverse effects of indoor air pollution. Common plants used to remediate indoor air pollutants include: English ivy (<i class="scientific_name">Hedera helix</i>), Peace lily (<i class="scientific_name">Spathiphyllum ‘Mauna Loa’</i>), Chinese evergreen (<i class="scientific_name">Aglaonema modestum</i>), Bamboo palm (C<i class="scientific_name">hamaedorea seifrizii</i>), and Chrysanthemum (<i class="scientific_name">Chrysanthemum morifolium</i>). There are several studies that cite the plant microcosm as a mechanism to reduce indoor VOCs. The roots of indoor houseplants have also been proven to remove VOCs. In general, plants have to suck up the pollutant with their stomata during gas transfers to remove the VOCs. Controls of just pots alone and just a tray of water suggest that it is the soil microcosm that provides the pollutant sink. The role of the plants is to establish and maintain the species specific root-zone microbial communities.This mechanism was first suggested by Wolverton et al. in 1985. Houseplants also aid in humidity, temperature, and noise control. NASA conducted a two-year study in 1989 to test the ability of houseplants or potting soil to remove several VOCs from the air. The experiment included the chemicals benzene, TCE, and formaldehyde. The study was conducted in airtight experimental chambers. They found that bacterial counts correlated with increased chemical removal. Another finding was that when the same plants and soil were constantly exposed to a chemical such as benzene, their capacity to clean the air increased over time. This is because microorganisms have the ability to genetically adapt.Therefore, they change over time in order to utilize the toxic chemicals more efficiently as a food source. This phenomenon is used as a strategy to treat wastewater.</p>

        <h1>Psychological effects</h1>
            <p>A 2015 study showed that active interaction with houseplants "can reduce physiological and psychological stress compared with mental work." A critical review of the experimental literature concluded "The reviewed studies suggest that indoor plants can provide psychological benefits such as stress-reduction and increased pain tolerance. However, they also showed substantial heterogeneity in methods and results. We therefore have strong reservations about general claims that indoor plants cause beneficial psychological changes. It appears that benefits are contingent on features of the context in which the indoor plants are encountered and on characteristics of the people encountering them." The phenomenon of biophilia explains why houseplants have positive psychological effects. Biophilia describes humans’ subconscious need for a connection with nature. This is why humans are fascinated by natural spectacles such as waves or a fire. It also explains why gardening and spending time outdoors can have healing effects. Having plants in indoor living areas can have positive effects on physiological, psychological and cognitive health. There is an architectural design approach known as “complexity and order” that coincides with biophilic design. Complexity and order is defined as, “the presence of rich sensory information that is configured with a coherent spatial hierarchy, similar to the occurrence of design in nature.” Humans enjoy looking at things that are not boring but also not too complex. This design strategy is based on nature and human's response to designs in nature. The presence of plants and nature-inspired designs "is restorative and not dull like the modern cookie cutter designs."</p>
